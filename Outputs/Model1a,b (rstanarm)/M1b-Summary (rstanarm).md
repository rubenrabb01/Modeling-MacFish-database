### Obtaining means, SD, medians and 95% credible intervals of varying intercepts

In *fish_inter*, we have saved 4,000 posterior draws (from all 4 chains) for the varying intercepts Î±j of the 30 fishes. For example, the first column of the 4,000 by 30 matrix is a vector of 4,000 posterior simulation draws for the first fish's (*fi_species*:T449202_1) varying intercept Î±1. One quantitative way to summarize the posterior probability distribution of these 4,000 estimates for Î±1 is to examine their quantiles.

### Differences between species averages

Here I'll explore the posterior distribution of the differences between each two species with descriptive statistics and histograms

- The difference between the pike and pikeperch averages is:

`fish_diff1 <- fish_inter[, 1] - fish_inter[, 2]`

`mean <- mean(fish_diff1)`
`sd <- sd(fish_diff1)`
`quantile <- quantile(fish_diff1, probs = c(0.025, 0.50, 0.975))`
`quantile <- data.frame(t(quantile))`
`names(quantile) <- c("Q2.5", "Q50", "Q97.5")`
`diff_df1 <- data.frame(mean, sd, quantile)`
`round(diff_df1, 2)`

```
  mean   sd Q2.5 Q50 Q97.5
1  3.4 0.44 2.51 3.4  4.28

```
`ggplot(data = data.frame(fish_diff1),
       aes(x = fish_diff1)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black",
                 fill = "gray",
                 binwidth = 0.75) +
  scale_x_continuous("Score diffence between pike and pikeperch",
                     breaks = seq(from = -20,
                                  to = 20,
                                  by = 10)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(mean(fish_diff1),
                            quantile(fish_diff1,
                                     probs = c(0.025, 0.975))),
             colour = "red",
             linetype = "longdash") +
  geom_text(aes(0.45, 20, label = "mean = 3.4"),
            color = "red",
            size = 4) +
  geom_text(aes(9, 50, label = "SD = 0.44"),
            color = "blue",
            size = 4) +
  theme_bw( base_family = "serif")`

![M1b_s2](/Plots/M1b_s2.png "M1b_s2")

The expected difference comes to 3.88 with a standard deviation of 1.34 and a wide range of uncertainty. The 95% credible interval is [1.21,6.5], so we are 95% certain that the true value of the difference between the two species lies within the range, given the data

We also can get the proportion of the time that pike has a higher mean than pikeperch:

`prop.table(table(fish_inter[, 1] > fish_inter[, 2]))`

```
TRUE 
   1 
```

This means that the posterior probability that pike is better than pikeperch is 100%. Any pair of fishes within the sample of fishes can be compared in this manner.

- The difference between the pikeperch and wels averages averages is:

`fish_diff2 <- fish_inter[, 2] - fish_inter[, 3]`

`mean <- mean(fish_diff2)`

### Analyse posterior

#### Plot posterior

- Including random effects from *fi_species*

`library(bayesplot)`

`mcmc_areas(as.matrix(m1b), prob_outer = .999)`

![M1b_s5](/Plots/M1b_s5.png "M1b_s5")

- Excluding random effects from *fi_species*

`mcmc_areas(as.matrix(m1b), prob_outer = .999, pars = c("(Intercept)",  "b[(Intercept) fi_species:pikeperch]", "b[(Intercept) fi_species:pike]","b[(Intercept) fi_species:wels]"))`

![M1b_s6](/Plots/M1b_s6.png "M1b_s6")

- The three species have lot of probability mass on both sides of 0


#### Plot paired marginals

`mcmc_pairs(as.matrix(m1b),pars = c("(Intercept)",  "b[(Intercept) fi_species:pikeperch]", "b[(Intercept) fi_species:pike]","b[(Intercept) fi_species:wels]"))`
