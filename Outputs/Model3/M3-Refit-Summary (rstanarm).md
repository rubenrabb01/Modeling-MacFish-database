## Re-fit model 3 using different Bayesian input parameters:

- Increase the value of parameter `adapt_delta` to 0.95 (default is 0.8) as I had the warning messages:
```
1: There were 49 divergent transitions after warmup. Increasing adapt_delta above 0.95 may help. See
http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#divergent-transitions-after-warmup 
2: Examine the pairs() plot to diagnose sampling problems
```
